//! CHIP-8 Instruction Set Implementation
//!
//! This module provides a complete implementation of the CHIP-8 instruction set,
//! including instruction decoding and execution. The CHIP-8 virtual machine has
//! 35 different instructions that cover arithmetic, logic, memory operations,
//! control flow, graphics, and input handling.
